                    I am occasionally asked what the B in B-Tree means. (\ldots)
                    We wanted the name to be short, quick to type, easy to remember.
                    It honored our employer, Boeing Airplane Company, but we wouldn't have to request permission to use the name.
                    It suggested Balance. Rudolf Bayer was the senior researcher of the two of us. (\ldots)
                    I don't recall one meaning standing out above the others that day. 
                    Rudolf is fond of saying that the more you think about what the B could mean, the more you learn about B-Trees, and that is good.
